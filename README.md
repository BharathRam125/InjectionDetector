## 📌 **Overview**  
This project provides a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach** to detect web injection attacks. By structuring web request data into graph-based representations, the model improves pattern recognition and anomaly detection.  

⚠ **Disclaimer:**  
✔ **The model is not final** and is still under development.  
✔ The dataset used is a **test dataset** and might not fully cover all real-world attack scenarios.  
✔ The model currently focuses on **SQLi, XSS, and Command Injection** only.  

---

## 🏗 **Model Architecture**  
The **GCN-based model** consists of:  
✔ **Three-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** for feature extraction.  
✔ **Batch Normalization & Dropout** for stable training and regularization.  
✔ **Fully Connected Layers** for final classification.
